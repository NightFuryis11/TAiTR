 ABOUT ME
   Hi guys, this is NightFuryis11! Well, people call me Night around the public sphere. I'm a small-time YouTuber and a high
school student, as well as an (almost Eagle) Boy Scout. For the longest time, I've had such facination with certain mods for both
Terraria and Minecraft, but only recently have I decided to try my hand at it. This mod is the result. THis is just one of the
many projects I've worked on, though most are for my YouTube channel.


HOW TO CONTACT AND SUPPORT ME
  The best way to contact me is via the email <nightsyt@gmail.com> or on Discord <NightFuryis11#6421>. I have many server-type
methods of contact as well:

not to be used for the mod directly, at this point, it'll be put towards my assorted YouTube endeavors.


ABOUT THE MOD
  This mod was originally born as an idea by Terraria COmmunity Forum user ProfessorBoo, under the pseudonym The Adventures in
Terraria. After a hefty amount of dicussion, Boo seemed to fall out of contact with the rest of us, and ideas started slowing
down. Up until this point, the only actual work that had been put into the mod was a handful of sprites I myself had made, but
even these were highly conceptual. After some time, after it had become clear that Boo was not going to become active any time
soon, I took it upon myself to try to revive the mod. I made a new Forum discussion, christening it The Adventures in Terraria
Remade. Even after this, not much happened until late 2019. At that point, I decided to start learning to code it myself. I'm
still terribly new at this, so if you see something that could be cleaned up, don't feel shy to contact me and let me know.
Regardless, at this point, the mod is planned to be a mid-size content mod, adding sparce additions throughout normal Terraria
progression, as well as some post-Moon Lord content and several major biomes to explore. This mod will also continue to grow,
likely in small chunks over big releases.


HOW TO INSTALL
  There are two ways to go about installing this mod. The first is simply from the Mod Browser embedded inside tModLoader
itself. As you would any other mod, simply go into the Mod Browser, install, and enable the mod. Then create a new world (to get
all the benefits, not just the content), and hop in to play! The second way to install is to download the .tmod file off of
Dropbox <Links under construction>, and put it directly into your tModLoader folder <Directories also under construction>.


CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAUSE
  If you would like to contribute to the mod code-wise, please follow the following Code of Contribution:
  
    1 - Please be completely sure your code works before creating a pull request. This includes testing it yourself on your own
        client with your altered version of the code as well as recording video evidence of your code working, should you be
        asked to provide it (most likely in the event of the code not functioning the same on my end).
