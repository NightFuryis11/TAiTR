If you would like to contribute to The Adventures in Terraria Remade Mod ("The Mod") code-wise, you must follow the Terms stated
   in the Code of Contribution (CoC) below:
  
    1 - Please be completely sure your code works before creating a pull request. This includes testing it yourself on your own
        client with your altered version of the code as well as recording video evidence of your code working, should you be
        asked to provide it (most likely in the event of the code not functioning the same on my end).
        
    2 - Do not alter a line of code unless you are sure of what it does. Things that may seem unnecessary may be necessary,
        or at least be the only way I knew how to make that particular action occur. If you find an alternate code that
        accomplishes the same action but is cleaner, that is acceptable but generally unnecessary, and may make my own additions
        harder.
        
    3 - NEVER commit a code alteration directly to the master branch unless you are a registered colaborator. When you suggest a
        code alteration, create a new brand following the name format <file altered>-<purpose for altering>. Also include a
        detailed description of why you proposed the alteration. Try to follow closely the format given by the example pull
        request and example issue.
        
    4 - In general, unless you know what you're doing, it is safer to create an issue report for something that could be done
        better, or needs fixed, instead of trying to fix it yourself.
        
    5 - If you successfully propose an alteration or fix to the code, and it is accepted, your username will be put at the end
        of the .cs file in a // comment. Do not do this yourself, but wait for it do be done by a colaborator.
  
  
  By proposing an alteration to the code of The Mod you accept and agree to abide by the Terms stated in the CoC above. Failure to
    abide by the Terms may waive any recognition you should otherwise recieve, including those listed in Term 5 of the CoC and any
    portion of the Copyright and its protections and responsibilities you would have otherwise been entitled to.
